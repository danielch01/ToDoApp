# Todo App

This is a To-do list application that uses PHP's PDO methods to connect to a MySQL server and retrieves tasks that were submitted by users. The purpose of this project is to become adept at PHP and navigating my way around the MySQL server and learn from beginner mistakes. The front end will use Twitter's Bootstrap library with JQuery mixed in.

Design inspiration from:
- Any.do
- Wunderlist
- iOS Reminders App

List of Bower packages:
`bower install angular angular-ui-router bootstrap jquery`

Important Notes and Things I Learned on the Way:
- PDO is far superior to MySQLi
